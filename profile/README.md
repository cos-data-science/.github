# About Data Requests

## TL;DR
- Please submit all new data requests using this [Asana Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=ASlQaWxI4pbzgnr--u9goA&d=30849970456832)
- No "urgent" requests.  Please submit an inquiry *at least 2 weeks* before you actually need the data.
- Intended for ad-hoc requests only.  See [Reporting](https://app.asana.com/1/30849970456832/project/1210755604814083/list/1210775927949128) for the reports and services we provided on a recurring basis.
- Data Science reviews new requests every Wednesday.
- Depending on when in the week you submit your request, you can expect to wait up to 1 additional week before Data Science will see and evaluate your request.  Please plan accordingly.
- Data Science prioritizes tasks according to mission alignment, expertise, date of receipt, and urgency (in descending order of importance)

## FAQ

###  Will there also be a #external-requests-data Slack channel for submitting requests?
No, at least not at this time. Â  We may revisit this option in the future, but we would probably only do so as a front-end connection to the request form and as a place to consolidate request-related communication and follow-up discussions in the future.

### How should we communicate about pending requests?
All request-related correspondence will occur within the "Comments" section of the corresponding Asana task.Â  Please get in the habit of checking your submitted requests regularly and/or enabling the proper notifications on your Asana account.

As a Slack-heavy org, we understand that project-related communications may occasionally (or frequently....) spillover into Slack conversations and threads.Â  This is fine, but just be advised that those conversations will be added into the "Comment" section of the related Asana task in order to ensure that we have a single, consolidated log of record regarding the provenance of all requests we handle.

### What will happen to the old "Data Requests" board onÂ  Asana?
The legacy request board was archived on August 22, 2025 and we no longer check it.

### To whom will my data requests be visible?
All tasks within the new [Data Requests](https://app.asana.com/1/30849970456832/project/1209048441067566/list/1210632739439319) project will be visible to everyone in the org (i.e., "Viewer" status).Â  In rare instances--such as requests involving the use of controlled-access data, sensitive inquiries, etc.--we may restrict access to the request task.

You will be added as a Collaborator to every request you submit and will have the option to manage additional Collaborators on the request.Â  Collaborators will not have edit rights to the request task, although they will be allowed to submit comments and download relevant attachments (if any).

### Where will my deliverables live and how will I be able to access them when my request is completed?
It depends  : )

We will likely provide link(s) to the relevant files and/or codebase.Â  In most circumstances, you will not have direct edit rights to the deliverables. Â  Any additional work you'd like to do with the output(s) of your request will have to be made on derivative copies.

### When does data science meet to review new requests?
Every Wednesday, typically in the afternoon (Eastern)

### So what happens if I submit something on a Thursday and need it for the following Tuesday?
Likely nothing.   We understand that "emergencies" happen and will do our best to work with you when something urgent and unexpected falls on your plate, but we will generally be unable to accommodate requests with deadlines less than two weeks from the date of submission.

### What happens in these weekly request review meetings?
These review (a.k.a "backlog grooming") meetings are when data science:

- Assesses all new requests submitted during the previous week for relevance, feasibility, and prioritization in light of all other new and in-progress requests
- Reviews the status of requests-in-progress and make any necessary adjustments to prioritization, scope, and/or anticipated timeline for delivery
  
### How are requests triaged and prioritized by data science?

As stated at the top of the Data Service Request Form, evaluation focuses on the following criteria, in descending order of importance:

- **Mission alignment** - Data Science prioritizes requests that speak directly to COS' core mission, engage meaningfully with COS' Theory of Change, and/or enhance our collective understanding of Lifecycle Open Science.Â  Please make this connection explicit in your request.
- **Expertise and specialization** - Requests requiring the skillsets, expertise, and/or computational and data resources unique to Data Science will be prioritized over those that could be reasonably performed by others within the requestor's group/team.
- **Date received** - All else being equal, requests will be prioritized in the order in which they are received
- **Urgency** - All else being equal, requests with more immediate deadlines will be prioritized above those with deadlines further in the future.

### Can I submit a request on recurring basis?
Yes, you can, but there is no guarantee that data science will be able to oblige.   Adjustments to frequency and/or the scope of the request may need to be adjusted in light of other factors.

The [Reporting Project](https://app.asana.com/1/30849970456832/project/1210755604814083/list/1210775927949128) on Asana project is where data science manages and communicates to stakeholders about regularly-scheduled data services (e.g., dashboard, reports, dataset updates, etc.)

We are always happy to learn about new services and products that you'd like to have on a recurring basis, but these are  often larger commitments---especially in earlier stages of development before.  The data science department and the Data Science Working Group meet regularly to review both sets of efforts (ad-hoc requests and recurring reports) and make adjustments as needed.

### How will I know if my request is out-of-scope?
You won't until you ask.   If in doubt, submit it, anyway.   It helps us learn what people *think*  is within our jurisdiction so that we can plan accordingly for future investment and/or revisit how we communicate to the broader about what data science is and does at COS.
